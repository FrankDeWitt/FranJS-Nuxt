# What is a counter?

Reactivity is an essential feature in modern web application development. It is a mechanism that allows developers to create applications that automatically react to changes in data, making the user interface more dynamic and fluid.

An example of reactivity is a counter in an application developed with Vue.js. In this case, the counter is a variable that is in the state of the application, and its value can be modified through a series of events, such as clicking a button. When the value of the counter changes, the application automatically updates to reflect the new value in the user interface.

Reactivity in Vue.js is achieved through the use of a system of observers, which watch for changes in the data and automatically update the user interface accordingly. This mechanism is very efficient, as only the parts of the UI that need to be updated are updated, rather than updating the entire application.

In summary, reactivity is an essential feature in modern web application development that allows developers to create more dynamic and fluid applications. The use of reactivity in a counter in a Vue.js application illustrates how this feature can make the user interface more efficient and user-friendly.ton.
